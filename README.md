# 📊 COVID-19 Epidemic Trends Analysis (2022) – R

## 📖 Description
This project aims to model and analyze COVID-19 epidemic trends using advanced statistical methods.  
The study leverages **regression**, **clustering**, and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to better understand the evolution of the virus and the factors influencing its spread.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze epidemic trends based on available data.
- Model COVID-19 evolution using statistical regression.
- Apply **clustering** to identify groups of similar regions.
- Use **PCA** to reduce dimensionality and extract the most influential factors.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language**: R  
- **Main Packages**:
  - `ggplot2` (visualization)
  - `dplyr` (data manipulation)
  - `caret` (modeling)
  - `factoextra` (PCA & clustering)
  - `glm` (regression)
